# EV-Data-Analysis-Mini-Project-
Exploratory Data Analysis and Power BI Dashboard on Electric Vehicle dataset
## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Electric Vehicle dataset and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to extract meaningful insights from the data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and clean raw EV data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Build a business-oriented Power BI dashboard

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Electric Vehicle Dataset)
- The dataset includes details such as:
  - Model
  - Segment
  - Battery capacity (kWh)
  - Driving range (km)
  - Efficiency
  - Top speed
  - Charging type

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & EDA
- Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization
- Excel – Initial data inspection

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
